## Project

**MindMosaic v1 MVP** — adaptive learning platform for NAPLAN Y5 Numeracy + ICAS Math Paper C. Solo build, 75-day target.

Locked sources of truth (do not edit silently):

- `mindmosaic-spec-v4_4.md` — product spec
- `mindmosaic-backend-arch-v2_0.md` — backend architecture
- `DEV_PLAN.md` — 75-day stage plan
- `BUILD_CONTRACT.md` — engineering rules
- `CLAUDE_PROMPTS.md` — full prompt catalogue (morning / stage / evening / audit / scope-cut / hotfix / retro / cold-start). The morning + evening rituals quoted below are the daily-use subset; the full catalogue lives there.
- `CLAUDE_DESIGN_PROMPTS.md` — Claude Design prompt catalogue (design-system setup + per-screen prototypes for Stage 22+ UI work). Prototypes are visual reference only per `UI_CONTRACT.md §1.1`.
- `mindmosaic-spec-v4_4.md` Part III.5 + arch v2.0 Part XI — G1–G6 ambiguity resolutions
- `UI_CONTRACT.md` + `SCREEN_SPECS.md` — frontend authority
- `OWNERS.md` — service ownership

If reality and the plan disagree: log a deviation, file an ADR if the answer is non-obvious, **never silently change the plan**.

---

## Tech stack (locked — change requires an ADR)

Turborepo + pnpm 9; Next.js 14 App Router; TypeScript strict; Tailwind + Radix UI primitives (ADR-0020: "shadcn/ui" wording in earlier versions meant Radix-based; Stage 13 implements Radix directly without shadcn CLI); Supabase (Postgres 15, RLS, Edge Functions in Deno); Vitest + Playwright + pgTAP; Recharts; KaTeX; @dnd-kit/core; Stripe (from Stage 42 only).

---

## v1 scope (firm)

**In v1:** AdaptiveEngine (NAPLAN), LinearEngine (ICAS), SkillEngine (practice), DiagnosticEngine; L1 Foundation, L2 Behaviour, L3a Causal-scoped (sync) + L3b/L5/L7/L9 (async from Stage 28); Student/Parent/Teacher/Admin dashboards; assignments; in-app notifications; Stripe Free/Standard/Premium (Stages 42–47).

**Deferred to v1.1+ (see `DEV_PLAN.md` §5):** RepairEngine, L4/L6/L8, Selective/Singapore/Olympiad pathways, Engagement layer, dunning/refund flows, full WCAG audit, OpenTelemetry, mobile polish, institutional tier, SSO.

Phase-2 features in code must be either entirely absent or stubbed with `// PHASE-2:` comments and "Available in a future release" UI copy. Grep-detectable.

---

## Quality non-negotiables

These hold for every commit. CI enforces what it can; you enforce the rest.

- TypeScript strict; **no `any` in production code**.
- Zod validation at every API boundary.
- RLS in the same migration as `CREATE TABLE` — never a follow-up migration.
- `Idempotency-Key` header on every `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`.
- Structured JSON logs with `trace_id`, `tenant_id`, `student_id` where applicable.
- p95 latencies meet `BUILD_CONTRACT §10` budgets — measure, don't assume.
- Conventional Commits with scope: `feat(web):`, `fix(api):`, `chore(security):`, `test(e2e):`, `docs(adr):`.
- Atomic commits. One stage = one commit to `main`. No `.only` or `.skip` left in tests.

---

## Spec ambiguity discipline

When implementing, if a spec value (an enum value, a column, a field
in a JWT claim, a policy name, a function signature, a default value)
is referenced in spec/arch but does NOT exist in the schema you have
in hand:

1. STOP. Do not invent a workaround.
2. File Q-NNNN in docs/dev/QUESTIONS.md describing:
   - The spec citation (file + section + exact text)
   - What's missing
   - The two-or-three plausible resolutions
   - Which one you'd default to and why
3. Surface this in your reply BEFORE producing code or commits.
4. Wait for human decision OR — if non-blocking — proceed with your
   default and file an ADR documenting the choice.

Examples that should trigger this discipline:

- "actor_role = 'self_service_signup'" (not in user_role enum)
- "feature_flag.source = 'admin_override'" (only if not in
  defined source enum values)
- A column or table referenced by name in spec but not in
  the migration list

The cost of stopping for 5 minutes to ask is always lower than
the cost of working around it and discovering the workaround
was wrong three stages later.

---

## Decision-recording rule

Any decision not specified by the daily prompt **must** be recorded as an ADR in `docs/dev/decisions/`. Examples:

- Choosing a library not pre-listed in the tech stack
- Resolving a spec ambiguity by picking a reading
- Choosing between two implementations the prompt was silent on
- Postponing or simplifying something the prompt asked for

Examples that do **not** need an ADR (use `DAILY_LOG.md` instead):

- Standard implementation choices clearly implied by the prompt
- Bug fixes — those go in `docs/dev/bugs/`
- Test additions

---

## Read-on-start order (every session)

Before any work, read in this order and produce a state summary:

1. `docs/dev/PROJECT_STATE.md` — full
2. `docs/dev/DAILY_LOG.md` — last 3 entries only
3. `docs/dev/DEVIATIONS.md` — all entries
4. `docs/dev/OPEN_ISSUES.md` — severity ≥ medium
5. `docs/dev/QUESTIONS.md` — open only
6. `docs/dev/decisions/` — ADRs marked `accepted` within last 14 days

State summary must include: last completed stage, next stage, open blockers, recent deviations relevant to today, known issues that might affect today, ADRs to be aware of. **Do not begin coding until the human confirms.**

---

## Morning ritual (paste at session start)

```
We are continuing the MindMosaic v1 build per DEV_PLAN.md.

Before any new work:

1. Read docs/dev/PROJECT_STATE.md (full)
2. Read docs/dev/DAILY_LOG.md (last 3 entries only)
3. Read docs/dev/DEVIATIONS.md (all)
4. Read docs/dev/OPEN_ISSUES.md (severity ≥ medium)
5. Read docs/dev/QUESTIONS.md (open only)
6. List ADRs in docs/dev/decisions/ accepted in last 14 days; read those
   relevant to today's stage.

Then report:
  - Last completed: Stage N (date)
  - Next stage: Stage N+1 — <title>
  - Open blockers: <list or "none">
  - Deviations relevant to today: <list or "none">
  - Known issues that may affect today: <list or "none">
  - Open ADRs to be aware of: <list or "none">

Then load Stage N+1 from DEV_PLAN.md and walk me through:
  (a) any preconditions you suspect might fail given current state
  (b) the planned work, restated in your own words
  (c) the C-C-D-V prompt you'll execute (Context / Constraints /
      Deliverables / Verification)

Do NOT begin coding until I confirm.
```

---

## Evening ritual (paste at session end)

```
Stage N is complete. Update the developer context.

1. Append today's entry to docs/dev/DAILY_LOG.md using the template at
   the top of that file. Fill every field; if N/A write "n/a".

2. Overwrite docs/dev/PROJECT_STATE.md with a fresh snapshot. Pull real
   numbers from CI / build output. Do not invent — if unknown, write
   "unknown — TODO measure".

3. For any decision made today not specified by the stage, file an ADR
   at docs/dev/decisions/NNNN-short-slug.md (next sequential number).

4. For any deviation from planned scope, append to docs/dev/DEVIATIONS.md.

5. For any new known issue, append to docs/dev/OPEN_ISSUES.md.

6. For any new question for spec/product owner, append to
   docs/dev/QUESTIONS.md.

7. For any new bug, file at docs/dev/bugs/BUG-NNNN-short-slug.md.

8. Save the executed C-C-D-V prompt to
   docs/prompts/YYYY-MM-DD_stage-N.md.

9. Run `pnpm install && pnpm turbo typecheck --force` (cache-bust,
   ISSUE-0029 / DEV-20260527-1 fix). All 16 packages must pass with
   0 entries served from turbo cache. If any package fails, fix before
   committing — do NOT commit with a cached-green claim.

10. Stage all docs/dev changes and commit separately with:
      chore(dev-context): stage N close — <one-line summary>

Show me the commit message and the diff before pushing.
```

**Anti-patterns:**

1. Editing `DEV_PLAN.md` **active stage definitions** (Phase 0–4 stage lists, exit criteria, day budgets) mid-build — file a deviation instead. The §5 post-launch backlog is the exception: it is additive documentation tracking v1.1+ work and may be edited directly to record new backlog items traceable to existing issues/deviations.

   Precedent: Q-25.1 / DEV-20260515-1 (route-target divergence → filed as deviation) vs Stage 27 §5 additions P1.6/P1.7/P2.10 (post-launch backlog → edited directly).
2. Deleting log entries — append a dated correction.
3. Vague entries ("fixed bug") — every entry must be useful 6 months later.
4. ADRs for trivial choices — ADRs are for decisions a senior reviewer would reasonably challenge.
5. Inventing numbers in `PROJECT_STATE.md` — write `unknown — TODO measure`.
6. Skipping the evening ritual — too tired to update context = too tired to commit.

- Blocking? yes / no
- Assumed answer (if proceeding): <…>
- Code affected: <file paths>
- Status: open | resolved
- Resolution: <answer + date>
```

---

## Severity rubric (for OPEN_ISSUES + bugs)

- **Critical** — blocks correctness/security. Fix before next commit.
- **High** — blocks a future stage or violates a quality gate. Fix within 2 days.
- **Medium** — measurable regression but not blocking. Fix by next audit.
- **Low** — cosmetic. Address opportunistically.

---

## Pruning policy (audit days — every 5 stages)

- `OPEN_ISSUES.md` — resolved → `## Resolved` with resolution date
- `QUESTIONS.md` — answered → `## Resolved` with answer
- `DAILY_LOG.md` — never pruned
- `DEVIATIONS.md` — never pruned
- `decisions/` — never deleted; supersede with new ADR if reversed
- `bugs/` — never deleted; mark `status: closed`

---

## T-Discipline (canonised Stage 41 from Stages 28–40 retros)

Full rationale + per-rule precedent history: `docs/dev/ui-discipline.md`.

- **T1** — Pre-read target files verbatim with file:line citations. Cite function signatures, default parameter values, and Zod schema field names verbatim before any C-C-D-V authorship or implementation.
- **T2-tightened** — File mid-implementation Qs in `QUESTIONS.md ## Resolved` in the same work session as the resolving code. Not deferred to pre-push or evening ritual.
- **T3 Option 3 hybrid** — Round-trip required for structural decisions (DTO shape, scope, schema, auth model). Self-resolve permitted for tight implementation details (thresholds, filter inclusivity, error codes) with documented options + default cited.
- **T4** — Never `--amend` over a commit already on `origin/main`. Fix-then-push. Pre-push verification catches the gap while still in working tree.
- **T5** — UI stages: mockup-driven layout sketch surfaced for operator approval BEFORE component code. Mid-impl skeleton checkpoint at end of layout pass (before data wiring) — operator may request adjustments.

---

## Pre-push verification round (MANDATORY)

Every stage close surfaces verification round to architect BEFORE push. Round includes:

- Q-* status verbatim (T2-tightened evidence)
- Pre-read findings (T1 citations)
- Test enumeration (verbatim names, diff against C-C-D-V plan)
- Stale-comment grep output
- Mojibake check on every modified `.md`
- ADR-0029 SDK prefix grep (no stale hook paths)
- Co-Authored-By absence confirmed in commit message
- Full `pnpm -r run test` output captured (not tail-truncated)

Reference: `docs/dev/ui-discipline.md §Pre-push verification round` for the full V1–V11 catalogue.

---

## Pre-commit secret guard (ISSUE-0037 remediation)

`.githooks/pre-commit` rejects any staged line of the form `KEY=<prefix><value>` where
`<prefix>` is one of `sb_secret_`, `sb_publishable_`, `sk_live_`, `sk_test_`, `eyJ` AND
`<value>` contains BOTH a lowercase letter AND a digit (the real-key entropy heuristic).
Placeholders like `sb_secret_REPLACE_WITH_LOCAL_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES,
no digits) and `sk_test_your-stripe-secret-key` (lowercase, no digits) pass through.

Activate once per clone: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

The guard is local defense-in-depth ahead of GitHub's remote push-protection. Coverage gap by
design: any value missing either lowercase letters or digits is treated as a placeholder, so
all-numeric or all-uppercase keys (rare in practice) would slip through; the remote scanner
catches those.

---

## Push gate

After the verification round passes, architect responds with the literal phrase **"create the commit"** before any push. Applies to prep, impl, and chore-close commits separately. No bundled approvals.

---

## Close-ritual cache-bust (ISSUE-0029 fix)

Pre-close gate runs `pnpm install && pnpm turbo typecheck --force` to bypass turbo cached green on unchanged source files when transitive deps have drifted. All 16 packages must pass with 0 entries served from cache. Resolves DEV-20260527-1.
