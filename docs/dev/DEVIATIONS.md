### DEV-20260430-1 — engines-client deferred from Stage 1 to Stage 15

- Date: 2026-04-30
- Stage: 1
- Type: postponement
- What the stage said: Stage 1 deliverables include `packages/engines-client` with `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/index.ts` re-exporting contract types only.
- What I actually did: Did not create `packages/engines-client`. Created the other 5 packages (`@mm/types`, `@mm/sdk`, `@mm/ui`, `@mm/core`, `@mm/engines`) as specified.
- Why: `engines-client` is a browser-safe thin re-export of `AssessmentEngine` contract types from `@mm/engines`. Those contracts don't exist until Stage 15. An empty package with no real exports adds dead weight to the build graph for 14 stages. See ADR-0001 for full reasoning.
- Impact on later stages: Stage 15 must create `packages/engines-client` per its deliverables list (already specified there — no plan change needed).
- Linked: ADR-0001 (`docs/dev/decisions/0001-engines-client-deferred.md`). Note: DEV_PLAN.md references a legacy ID "DEV-20260426-1" for this same decision from a prior attempt — this entry (DEV-20260430-1) supersedes it with today's date. Do NOT edit DEV_PLAN.md.
- Resolved by: Stage 15
