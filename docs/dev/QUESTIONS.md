### Q-20.15 — Sync HTTP timeout + error fallback semantics

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: BUILD_CONTRACT §10 (5s p95 budget on `/submit`); arch §5.2 (3-attempt
  retry policy on pipeline.run_sync); spec §7.2 line 1020
  ("session remains in `submitted` state and a retry is scheduled immediately")
- Question: What HTTP timeout for the inline intelligence-svc call from
  `/submit`, and what error categories trigger soft-fallback vs propagate?
- Why ambiguous: §7.2 says "retry scheduled immediately" but §5.2 retry policy
  is owned by the worker (Stage 28+); Stage 20 has no worker yet.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/handlers.ts` submitSession
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): 4000 ms HTTP timeout (1s safety margin under the
  5s `/submit` p95 budget). On timeout / 4xx / 5xx / network error → return
  submit success with `pipeline_status='pending'` + log warn; never fail the
  user-facing submit. The Stage 10 outbox-dispatcher cron's queued
  `pipeline.run_sync` job becomes the retry path (worker exists Stage 28+).
  Documented in **ADR-0027**.

### Q-20.14 — `trace_id` propagation header

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: arch §7.4 audit-log requirements; existing
  `supabase/functions/_shared/trace-id.ts` (basic UUID gen)
- Question: Header name + propagation strategy from assessment-svc to
  intelligence-svc?
- Why ambiguous: First inter-service HTTP call requiring trace_id
  propagation (Stage 18 content-svc was service-role-keyed only, no trace
  flow).
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/_shared/trace-id.ts`,
  `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/handlers.ts`,
  `supabase/functions/intelligence-svc/index.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): `x-mm-trace-id` HTTP header. assessment-svc
  generates if absent; passes via header to intelligence-svc;
  intelligence-svc writes the same `trace_id` to all `intelligence_audit_log`
  rows + `pipeline_event` rows in this run. Standard observability pattern.
  No ADR needed.

### Q-20.13 — `intelligence_audit_log.input_snapshot` scope

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: spec §7.4.2 (audit-log replay safety); ADR-0013 (column projection)
- Question: Full session_response payload or per-skill aggregates?
- Why ambiguous: Replay determinism wants smallest possible deterministic
  input; debuggability wants the full payload.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/intelligence-svc/handlers.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Per-skill aggregates only —
  `{ skills: [{ skill_id, attempts, correct, mastery_before, mastery_after,
  ... }] }` sorted by `skill_id ASC`, canonicalised via the
  `_shared/intelligence-helpers.ts:canonicalize()` helper. Hash-friendly,
  bounded, deterministic. Documented in **ADR-0027**.

### Q-20.12 — `guess_probability` storage location

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: product owner
- Source: DEV_PLAN Stage 20 deliverables ("per-response `guess_probability`
  in `learning_event.metadata`"); spec §7.6 schema embedding
  `guess_probability` in answer event metadata; OWNERS.md `assessment-svc`
  WRITE row marking `learning_event` as immutable
- Question: Per-response storage path: (A) new `learning_event_type` enum
  value `'behaviour_signal'` + INSERT new rows, (B) relax `learning_event`
  mutability and UPDATE answer-row metadata, or (C) aggregate-only in v1?
- Why ambiguous: Spec §7.6 schema describes per-response storage *as if* the
  field is set at response time; §9.2 formula needs session-end
  `recent_responses` for `pattern_factor` (so it must be computed
  post-session); OWNERS.md immutability invariant blocks the UPDATE path.
- Blocking? yes
- Code affected: `supabase/migrations/0013_behaviour_signal_event_type.sql`
  (NEW, if A); `supabase/functions/intelligence-svc/handlers.ts`;
  `supabase/migrations/0001_enums_tenancy_auth.sql` (enum extended)
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): **A**. Migration 0013 ALTERs `learning_event_type`
  enum to add `'behaviour_signal'`; intelligence-svc INSERTs one new
  `learning_event` row per answer response carrying L2 per-response signals
  in `metadata`. Preserves immutability invariant (new rows, no UPDATEs).
  One enum value covers all current and future L2 per-response signals
  without further migrations. Migration 0013 must be tested via
  `pnpm test:migration` locally before deploy (sandbox lacks Docker — same
  caveat as 0012). Documented in **ADR-0027**.

### Q-20.11 — `distractor_rationale` JSON shape

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: `supabase/migrations/0002_content_skill_graph.sql:195`
  (`distractor_rationale jsonb` column on `item_version`); spec §10
  ("misconception from `distractor_rationale`"); seed
  `supabase/seeds/02_content.sql:357–364`
- Question: Codified shape for L3a misconception lookup?
- Why ambiguous: Schema column is `jsonb`; no spec table specifies the shape.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/intelligence-svc/handlers.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Adopt the seed-de-facto shape:
  `{ [choice_id: string]: { misconception_id: string } }` with absent entries
  for untagged choices (seeds use `jsonb_strip_nulls`). For each incorrect
  response, look up `distractor_rationale[response.choice_id]?.misconception_id`;
  if present → UPSERT `student_misconception`. Documented in **ADR-0027**.

### Q-20.10 — L3a depth-1 prerequisite walk

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: spec §7.2 ("L3a is bounded: touched_skills × 1 prerequisite
  layer"); spec §10.2 `find_root_causes` recursive helper
- Question: Inline a depth-1 walk in Stage 20, or wait for Stage 28's
  full `traverse_upstream`?
- Why ambiguous: DRY argues for one helper; YAGNI argues for the bounded
  version now.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/_shared/intelligence-helpers.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Inline `walkPrereqsDepth1(skillIds, skillEdges)`
  in `_shared/intelligence-helpers.ts` returning `Set<skill_id>` (sorted
  output). Reads from existing `_shared/skill-graph-cache.ts`. Stage 28's
  full traversal is a separate function. Spec §7.2's depth=1 bound is a
  performance contract — Stage 20 must enforce it; deferring to a generic
  helper risks accidental depth bleed.

### Q-20.9 — Year-level-aware behaviour defaults

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: spec §9.6 defaults table (Y1–3 → 15min, Y4–6 → 20min, Y7–9 →
  30min, Y10–12 → 40min for `avg_fatigue_onset_minutes`); migration 0005
  hardcoded defaults of 20/20
- Question: Read `user_profile.year_level` and apply year-keyed defaults,
  or accept the migration's Y4–6 defaults for all students?
- Why ambiguous: v1 only targets Y5 (NAPLAN) and Y5–6 (ICAS Math C);
  defaults work for the target audience. But student data outside that
  window will silently mis-default.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/intelligence-svc/handlers.ts`,
  `supabase/functions/_shared/intelligence-helpers.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Read `user_profile.year_level` and apply the
  spec §9.6 map. `_shared/intelligence-helpers.ts:yearLevelDefaults(year)`
  returns the right default per band. Cheap to do right once; no
  hard-to-find drift later.

### Q-20.8 — `pipeline_event` rows for sync steps 1/2/3

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: spec §7.2.1 (`pipeline_event` schema described as "step: int —
  4–9"); migration 0006 schema (`step int CHECK (step BETWEEN 1 AND 9)`);
  DEV_PLAN Stage 20 deliverables ("per-step `pipeline_event` rows")
- Question: Write `pipeline_event` rows for sync steps 1/2/3 too, or
  only the documented async 4–9?
- Why ambiguous: Spec prose says async-only; schema CHECK permits 1–9;
  DEV_PLAN says per-step.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/intelligence-svc/handlers.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Yes — write `pipeline_event` rows for sync steps
  1, 2, 3 (foundation, behaviour, causal-scoped). Status transitions
  `pending → processing → completed/failed` per row. DEV_PLAN literal +
  schema permits + better observability for the sync path. Spec §7.2.1
  prose is descriptive of the async case; the schema is the contract.

### Q-20.7 — Re-processing idempotency (Stage 28 worker pickup)

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: existing migration 0010 (Stage 10 outbox-dispatcher cron enqueues
  `pipeline.run_sync` job per submit); jobs-worker not built until Stage 28;
  arch §5.2 idempotency keys
- Question: How does intelligence-svc avoid re-processing when Stage 28's
  worker eventually picks up the orphan `pipeline.run_sync` jobs queued
  during Stages 20–27?
- Why ambiguous: Without a guard, the worker would re-execute against
  intelligence-svc; if `algorithm_version` had bumped in between, the
  second run could diverge from the first → replay determinism fails.
- Blocking? yes
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/intelligence-svc/handlers.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Audit-log dedup at handler entry on
  `(session_id, algorithm_version)`. intelligence-svc selects
  `intelligence_audit_log` for prior `event_type='session.processed'`
  rows; if any → return 200 `already_processed` without writing.
  Plus all writes UPSERT (skill_mastery, learning_velocity,
  behaviour_profile, student_misconception). Stage 28 worker call =
  no-op. Documented in **ADR-0027**.

### Q-20.6 — §21.0.2 vs §7.2 reconciliation

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: spec §21.0.2 line 2877 ("No synchronous inter-service HTTP
  calls"); spec §7.2 line 997 (sync portion "must complete before submit
  response is returned"); arch §4.5 (intelligence-svc endpoint)
- Question: How does Stage 20 reconcile §21.0.2's prohibition with §7.2's
  mandate for inline-before-submit?
- Why ambiguous: Two locked spec sections appear to contradict.
- Blocking? yes
- Code affected: ADR + future inter-service-HTTP decisions
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): §7.2 wins as the more-specific section. Treat
  the submit→intelligence-svc call as the *one* officially-blessed sync
  inter-service HTTP exception. §21.0.2's prohibition continues to bind
  every other inter-service call. Future stages adding inline HTTP must
  extend or supersede ADR-0027 — not silently broaden the door.
  Documented in **ADR-0027**.

### Q-20.5 — `processing_time_ms` measurement strategy

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: arch §7.4 audit-log requirements (`processing_time_ms` field);
  spec §7.2 (3s SLA)
- Question: One timer at handler entry/exit, or per-layer timers?
- Why ambiguous: Per-layer would help debug L1/L2/L3a contributions to
  the 3s budget.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/intelligence-svc/handlers.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Single `performance.now()` at handler entry,
  single delta at exit, written once to
  `intelligence_audit_log.output.processing_time_ms`. Per-layer breakdown
  is captured in `pipeline_event.started_at`/`completed_at` for steps 1, 2,
  3 (Q-20.8) — observability split is clean without sprinkling timers in
  the handler body.

### Q-20.4 — Replay-determinism floor

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: spec §7.4.2 (algorithm_version stamped for replay safety);
  DEV_PLAN Stage 20 risk row ("No `Math.random`, no floats summed in
  non-deterministic order, no timestamps as inputs")
- Question: What concrete code-level rules?
- Why ambiguous: DEV_PLAN sketches the rules; the floor needs to be
  enforceable.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/intelligence-svc/handlers.ts`,
  `supabase/functions/_shared/intelligence-helpers.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Forbid: `Math.random()`, `Date.now()` as
  algorithm input, `Set`/`Map` iteration order assumptions, default
  `JSON.stringify` on objects with non-deterministic key order. Use
  sorted-key serialisation in `_shared/intelligence-helpers.ts:canonicalize(obj)`
  for any hash input. ORDER BY on every aggregate (`skill_id ASC`,
  `response_id ASC`). Timestamps are write-only metadata, not formula
  inputs.

### Q-20.3 — `algorithm_version` format

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: spec §7.4.2; `intelligence_audit_log.algorithm_version text NOT
  NULL` column at migration 0005:120
- Question: Format string?
- Why ambiguous: Spec column requires text, no format codified.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/_shared/intelligence-helpers.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): `intelligence-vN.M.P` semver. Initial
  `intelligence-v1.0.0`. Major bumps on output-shape changes (audit-log
  schema migration), minor on formula changes (e.g., adjusting weights
  in mastery formula §8.1), patch on bugfix (e.g., off-by-one in 14-day
  velocity window). Stored as exported constant `ALGORITHM_VERSION` in
  `_shared/intelligence-helpers.ts`. Documented in **ADR-0027**.

### Q-20.2 — `pipeline_status` enum has `'sync_complete'`

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: `supabase/migrations/0001_enums_tenancy_auth.sql:71–73`
- Question: Does the existing `pipeline_status` enum include
  `'sync_complete'`, or does Stage 20 need a new migration?
- Why ambiguous: Quick verification before writing the handler.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: n/a
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Yes —
  `pipeline_status AS ENUM ('pending', 'sync_complete', 'async_complete',
  'async_partial', 'async_failed')` already exists from Stage 2.
  No migration needed for the enum.

### Q-20.1 — Sync trigger model

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 20 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: spec §7.2 line 997; arch §5.1 trigger flow; DEV_PLAN Stage 20
  ("called inline from submit"); Q-19.2 resolution
- Question: assessment-svc `/submit` calls intelligence-svc inline (HTTP),
  or does the trigger flow stay outbox-mediated?
- Why ambiguous: §7.2 says inline; arch §5.1 trigger flow shows outbox-
  mediated; §21.0.2 forbids sync inter-service HTTP categorically.
- Blocking? yes
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/handlers.ts`
  submitSession; `supabase/functions/intelligence-svc/index.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Inline HTTP from `/submit`. On 200 →
  `pipeline_status='sync_complete'`; on timeout/error → keeps
  `'pending'`. Outbox row + dispatcher's `pipeline.run_sync` job remain
  the retry path. §7.2 line 997 is decisive ("must complete before
  submit response is returned"); §21.0.2 reconciled per Q-20.6.
  Documented in **ADR-0027**.

### Q-19.13 — Mock-Supabase Proxy reuse strategy

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: Stage 18 `content-svc/__tests__/contract.test.ts:54–82`
- Question: Copy-paste the callable-Proxy mock into assessment-svc tests, or hoist
  to a shared `_test-helpers/` module?
- Why ambiguous: First reuse instance — DRY vs co-location is a judgement call.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/_test-helpers/`,
  `supabase/functions/content-svc/__tests__/contract.test.ts`,
  `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/__tests__/contract.test.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Hoist to `supabase/functions/_test-helpers/mock-supabase.ts`.
  content-svc test imports from there (no behaviour change). DRY beats co-location
  with two consumers; test-only utility, no runtime impact.

### Q-19.12 — `@mm/assessment-svc` package script set

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: Stage 18 precedent (`@mm/content-svc`); BUILD_CONTRACT §9
- Question: Should assessment-svc have lint/build scripts in addition to typecheck/test?
- Why ambiguous: Edge Function packages deploy via Supabase CLI, not pnpm build.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/package.json`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): typecheck + test only. Matches content-svc; no value in
  adding lint that wasn't there for content-svc. ESLint not configured for Edge
  Function code in v1.

### Q-19.11 — Rate-limit bucket key shape

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: arch §4.13; `0011_rate_limit_fn_outbox_cleanup.sql:9` `fn_check_rate_limit`
- Question: Bucket key format for `/sessions/respond` etc — composite endpoint:scope
  string vs structured?
- Why ambiguous: arch §4.13 specifies limits but not key shape.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/_shared/rate-limit.ts` callers in
  assessment-svc handlers
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): `<endpoint>:<student_id>` as `bucket_key` text;
  `window_start = date_trunc('minute', now())`. Matches existing
  `fn_check_rate_limit(p_bucket_key, p_window_start, p_limit)` signature and
  `rate_limit_bucket(bucket_key, window_start)` PK.

### Q-19.10 — Stage 19 commit boundary

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: BUILD_CONTRACT §11.1 (one stage = one atomic commit)
- Question: Single atomic commit or split (migration separately, then svc + e2e)?
- Why ambiguous: Stage 19 is 2 days of work touching migration, _shared/,
  assessment-svc, apps/web Playwright — large diff.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: git history
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Single atomic commit per BUILD_CONTRACT §11.1. Stage
  atomicity over PR-size aesthetics. Pre-implementation artefacts (this commit:
  ADR-0026, QUESTIONS resolutions, C-C-D-V archive) are doc-only and travel in
  a separate `chore(stage-19)` commit ahead of the implementation.

### Q-19.9 — Playwright setup scope for first e2e

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: DEV_PLAN.md Stage 19 deliverables ("Playwright e2e — signup → session
  create → 5 responses → submit → score returned")
- Question: Full Playwright setup (devDep + config + browser install + spec)
  or minimal SDK-CLI substitute?
- Why ambiguous: First e2e adds substantial setup overhead for a single happy-path.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `apps/web/package.json`, `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`,
  `apps/web/playwright/e2e/session-flow.spec.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Full Playwright setup. DEV_PLAN explicitly lists the
  e2e as a deliverable; the config + spec is reusable across Stages 22–25 frontend
  stages. CI integration deferred to Stage 26 (load-test stage). Browser install
  via `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`, documented at evening close.

### Q-19.8 — First-item provisioning model on `/sessions/create`

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: DEV_PLAN.md Stage 19 ("atomic write of session_record + first item");
  spec §3.6.1 `CreateSessionResponse`
- Question: Single multi-step DB transaction (across HTTP to content-svc) or
  multi-phase with idempotency-key + partial-unique-index as safety net?
- Why ambiguous: Edge Functions can't easily span a DB transaction across an
  HTTP call to another service.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/handlers.ts` createSession
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Multi-phase, with idempotency-key + the existing
  `idx_session_one_active` partial unique index (`0004_sessions_events.sql:76`)
  as the safety net. INSERT session_record(status=created) → HTTP /content/select
  → UPDATE engine_state + transition to active → return first item. Duplicate
  create via stale tab fails on the partial unique index; replay of the same
  Idempotency-Key returns the cached response.

### Q-19.7 — content-svc call from session-create

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: spec §21.0.2 ("No synchronous inter-service HTTP calls"); Stage 18
  Q-18.8 (content-svc `/content/select` is service-role only)
- Question: HTTP fetch to content-svc `/content/select` (sync) or inline the
  selection logic into assessment-svc?
- Why ambiguous: spec §21.0.2 prohibits sync inter-service HTTP for *core flow*;
  session-create is a one-off boundary call.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/handlers.ts` createSession
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): HTTP fetch to content-svc with `x-mm-service-role`
  header (env: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`). Mirrors Stage 18 contract; avoids
  forking the selection handler. session-create is a one-off (5/min rate limit
  per arch §4.13) so the round-trip cost is bounded. If perf concerns surface
  under load (Stage 26), revisit and inline.

### Q-19.6 — EngineState boundary parse on read

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: ADR-0023 (EngineState discriminated union); CLAUDE.md (Zod at every
  API boundary)
- Question: `EngineStateSchema.parse()` on every read of
  `session_record.engine_state_snapshot`, or trust the DB and cast?
- Why ambiguous: Edge Function is the only writer (Pattern G RLS), so a cast
  is *technically* safe; but the discipline elsewhere is parse-on-boundary.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/handlers.ts` (every handler
  that reads engine state)
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): `EngineStateSchema.parse()` on every read. ~1ms cost
  per respond; well within BUILD_CONTRACT §10 budget. Boundary discipline is
  uniform across the codebase; carving an exception here invites drift.

### Q-19.5 — Optimistic-lock failure semantics on `/respond`

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: DEV_PLAN.md Stage 19 exit criterion ("Version conflict surfaces 409");
  `create_session_response_atomic` raises `VERSION_CONFLICT` (P0001)
- Question: Surface 409 to client (client refreshes via /state and retries) or
  server-side retry?
- Why ambiguous: Server retry could mask transient races, but also masks genuine
  concurrent-tab bugs.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/handlers.ts` respondToSession
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Surface 409 `CONFLICT`. Client must GET /sessions/{id}/state
  and retry with the refreshed version + lock_token. Per DEV_PLAN exit criterion
  named test. Server-side retry would paper over genuine concurrent-tab bugs.

### Q-19.4 — Lock-token rotation lifecycle

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: arch §4.4 (`X-Session-Lock` required header); spec §3.4 (single-active-
  session invariant); `session_record.lock_token uuid` column already present
- Question: Single token at create vs rotate per respond vs time-windowed rotation?
- Why ambiguous: Spec/arch reference the column but don't pin lifecycle.
- Blocking? no (defaults to single-token if not addressed, but weakens
  /checkpoint and /abandon)
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/handlers.ts`,
  `packages/types/src/session.ts` (`RecordResponseResponseSchema` widening)
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Rotate `lock_token` on every successful create /
  respond / resume. Client echoes via `X-Session-Lock`; mismatch → 409
  `LOCK_CONFLICT`. Codified as a service pattern in **ADR-0026** for inheritance
  by assignments-svc (Stage 27+) and billing-svc (Stage 42+).

### Q-19.3 — Idempotency middleware vs in-handler

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: arch §7.3 (Idempotency Flow); `api_idempotency_key` table at
  `0004_sessions_events.sql:164`
- Question: Build a reusable `_shared/idempotency.ts` middleware or implement
  in-handler per endpoint?
- Why ambiguous: First idempotency-bearing service in v1 — pattern not yet
  established.
- Blocking? no
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/_shared/idempotency.ts` (NEW),
  `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/index.ts`
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): `_shared/idempotency.ts` middleware
  `withIdempotency(client, req, tenantId, endpoint, handler) → Response` per
  arch §7.3. Reusable for assignments-svc (Stage 27+), billing-svc (Stage 42+),
  orchestration-svc.

### Q-19.2 — Sync pipeline trigger in `/submit` (Stage 19 vs Stage 20 split)

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: DEV_PLAN.md Stage 19 deliverables ("/submit writes outbox_event +
  invokes sync pipeline inline"); spec §21.0.2 ("No synchronous inter-service
  HTTP calls"); arch §4.5 (`/intelligence/process-session/{id}` service-role
  inline from submit); Stage 20 owns intelligence-svc
- Question: Stage 19 invokes intelligence-svc inline (with stub), behind feature
  flag, best-effort, or outbox-only?
- Why ambiguous: intelligence-svc doesn't exist until Stage 20; spec §21.0.2 vs
  arch §4.5 wording reads contradictory at first glance.
- Blocking? yes (changes /submit's response shape and the e2e assertion)
- Code affected: `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/handlers.ts` submitSession,
  e2e spec
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Outbox-only for Stage 19; no intelligence-svc stub.
  `/submit` writes `outbox_event` with `aggregate_type='session_record'`,
  `event_type='session.submitted'`, returns `pipeline_status='pending'`. e2e
  asserts the outbox row exists with `processed_at IS NULL`. Stage 20 wires the
  inline sync HTTP call and flips `pipeline_status` to `'sync_complete'`.

### Q-19.1 — Persisting `engine_state_snapshot` on `/respond` atomically

- Date raised: 2026-05-08 (Stage 19 §2A)
- Asked of: self
- Source: `create_session_response_atomic` at `0004_sessions_events.sql:287`
  does not write `engine_state_snapshot`; replay determinism (DEV_PLAN Stage 26)
  requires engine-state ↔ session-response atomicity
- Question: Add a second non-atomic UPDATE, widen the RPC signature, or add a
  separate version-checked update RPC?
- Why ambiguous: RPC predates engines (Stage 4); atomicity vs migration churn
  tradeoff.
- Blocking? yes (replay determinism gate at Stage 26 depends on this)
- Code affected: `supabase/migrations/0012_assessment_svc_rpc_widen.sql` (NEW),
  `supabase/functions/assessment-svc/handlers.ts` respondToSession
- Status: resolved
- Resolution (2026-05-08): Migration 0012 widens the RPC signature to take
  `p_engine_state jsonb` as the 11th parameter; UPDATE clause writes
  `engine_state_snapshot = p_engine_state` in the same transaction as the
  version bump. Down migration restores the Stage 4 10-arg signature. pgTAP
  roundtrip extends to 12/12.

### Q-0001 — shadcn/ui integration approach for packages/ui

- Date raised: 2026-05-03 (Stage 13)
- Asked of: product owner
- Source: CLAUDE.md tech stack "Tailwind + shadcn/ui" vs BUILD_CONTRACT §9 (no shadcn reference)
- Question: Should Stage 13 primitives be built via (A) shadcn CLI vendoring, (B) Radix UI deps
  directly, or (C) pure Tailwind + React?
- Why ambiguous: shadcn is a codegen CLI, not a runtime dep. Our token system diverges heavily from
  shadcn defaults. Arch and BUILD_CONTRACT don't mention shadcn directly.
- Blocking? yes
- Assumed answer if proceeding: Option B (Radix directly)
- Code affected: all of packages/ui/src/
- Status: resolved
- Resolution: Option B approved by product owner 2026-05-03. Radix is the headless a11y layer
  shadcn wraps. Custom token system gains nothing from shadcn defaults. Lower dep graph, no CLI
  registry, identical a11y. ADR-0020 filed. CLAUDE.md tech stack updated to "Tailwind + Radix UI
  primitives". Commit: Stage 13 commit.
