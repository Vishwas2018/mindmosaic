# ADR-0041 — Content Import Pipeline Patterns

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-05-19
- Stage: v1.1-S6 prep
- Tags: backend | data | security | dx

## Context

v1.1 Stage 6 (Bulk Content Import Pipeline + Authoring Spec Templates) is the first content-operation
stage. Stages S1–S5 built the machinery (content-svc CRUD, lifecycle FSM, Zod-validated write paths at
b3eb668). S6 builds the leverage point: a batch import pipeline that lets content operators populate the
item bank at scale, and authoring spec templates that define the format contract for original items.

Spec §21.2 Content Service names `POST /content/import` as the key endpoint: "Bulk import items from JSON
(admin, with dry-run validation)." The v1.1-phase-plan.md §S6 describes the deliverables as a "Batch
import endpoint / script — `POST /content/items/batch` or a `scripts/import-items.ts`." These two sources
name different paths; spec §21.2 is authoritative (Q-1.1-6.2 resolution).

The copyright constraint from v1.1-phase-plan.md §Critical constraint is binding on every part of S6 and S7:

> "NAPLAN and ICAS are real, copyrighted assessment products with protected names. The content operation
> produces **original items only** — written fresh to match the _format, year-level curriculum strand,
> difficulty band, and question type_ of those assessments, without reproducing any actual past-paper item.
> No scraping of past papers, no licensed-bank ingestion, no copying. This constraint shapes every part of
> S6 and S7. It is not optional and not negotiable; treat it with the same weight as the child-safety and
> security non-negotiables in CLAUDE.md."

Five decisions were deferred to S6 morning ritual (v1.1-phase-plan.md §Open decisions). All five were
resolved via T3 round-trips on 2026-05-19, recorded in Q-1.1-6.1–6.6. This ADR documents those decisions
and their implementation consequences.

## Options considered

### Decision 1 — Batch import mechanism: HTTP endpoint shape (Q-1.1-6.1, Q-1.1-6.2)

1. **Option A — `POST /content/import` HTTP endpoint** — primary delivery mechanism; spec §21.2
   authoritative. Pattern G strict (platform_admin + service-role). Idempotency-Key required. Dry-run
   mode (`?dry_run=true`). No standalone script in S6 scope.
2. **Option B — `scripts/import-items.ts` service-role script** — avoids HTTP overhead; no
   Idempotency-Key required; simpler auth model. Pros: no new endpoint. Cons: non-authoritative per spec;
   no idempotency; harder to test as contract.
3. **Option C — Both** — HTTP endpoint + script wrapper. Pros: convenience. Cons: unneeded scope in S6.

### Decision 2 — Manifest copyright guardrail (Q-1.1-6.3 sub-question i)

1. **`copyright_declaration: z.literal('original')` required field** — manifest Zod schema rejects any
   item without explicit declaration. 422 on missing/invalid.
2. **No declaration field; lifecycle FSM gate only** — `draft → review` transition is the enforcement
   point; relies entirely on human review.
3. **Optional declaration field** — present but not required.

### Decision 3 — Duplicate-similarity check depth (Q-1.1-6.3 sub-question ii)

1. **Exact-match SHA of normalised stem JSON** — hash the `stem` JSON (keys sorted, whitespace
   normalised); compare against existing `item_version.stem` SHAs. O(1) lookup per item. Does not
   detect near-duplicates or paraphrase.
2. **Fuzzy / embedding-based check** — semantic similarity via pgvector embeddings or MinHash shingling.
   Catches near-duplicates. Requires additional infrastructure.

### Decision 4 — Legal review ownership (Q-1.1-6.3 sub-question iii)

Operational ownership question only; no code option. Owner = operator-side.

### Decision 5 — assessment-svc ISSUE-0042 carry (Q-1.1-6.4)

1. **Fix in S6** — add `CreateSessionRequestSchema.safeParse()` to `assessment-svc/index.ts:222`.
2. **Carry per ADR-0040** — non-blocking; address at next assessment-svc touch.

### Decision 6 — Lifecycle for imported items (Q-1.1-6.6)

1. **Draft only** — all imports land as `draft`; no override field in manifest.
2. **Optional lifecycle override** — manifest may specify target lifecycle (e.g., `review`).

## Decision

1. **Option A.** `POST /content/import` per spec §21.2. Phase plan's `/content/items/batch` is
   non-authoritative. No script in S6 scope. Idempotency-Key required on POST per CLAUDE.md
   non-negotiable. Pattern G strict: `platform_admin` role check (Bearer) OR service-role header
   (`x-mm-service-role`) — matching the dual-gate model used for `/content/select` (index.ts:116).
2. **Option 1.** `copyright_declaration: z.literal('original')` required field in manifest Zod
   schema. 422 on missing/invalid. The lifecycle FSM `draft → review` gate provides a second
   enforcement layer; the manifest field provides the first.
3. **Option 1 for S6.** Exact-match SHA on normalised stem JSON. Fuzzy deferred as ISSUE-0049.

   **§Decision 3 amendment (2026-05-19, Gate III):** Cross-DB stem SHA dedup deferred per
   Q-1.1-6.7 Option C — S6 delivers intra-manifest SHA Set only. Cross-import external_key
   dedup deferred per Q-1.1-6.8 Option B — S6 delivers intra-manifest Map only. Empty-bank
   rationale: at S6 launch the item bank contains 0 prior imports; cross-lookup against an
   empty set has no implementation value. Both `DUPLICATE_STEM` and `DUPLICATE_EXTERNAL_KEY`
   outcome codes are reserved in the response schema for the upgrade path. Upgrade tracked:
   ISSUE-0049 (fuzzy/embedding — DB schema + pgvector) + ISSUE-0050 (cross-DB SHA +
   cross-import external_key — idempotency store extension; distinct upgrade path).
4. Legal review owner: operator-side. S6 ships templates ready for review. No code gate.
5. **Carry per ADR-0040.** S6 does not touch assessment-svc write path.
6. **Draft only.** All imports land as `draft`. No lifecycle override field in manifest.

## Rationale

Pattern G strict (Decision 1): ADR-0035 §Decision 2 explicitly names "batch ingest" as a service-role
use case. Content writes are platform_admin + service-role only per established RLS policy.

Copyright declaration (Decision 2): The copyright constraint is a CLAUDE.md-equivalent non-negotiable.
Making it machine-enforceable at the import boundary is the minimum viable implementation. The declaration
field is the intake gate; human review at `draft → review` is the quality gate. Without the intake gate,
a batch of non-original items could be submitted without any machine-detectable signal.

Exact-match SHA (Decision 3): Scope-appropriate for S6. Verbatim duplicates (same batch re-imported) are
the primary dedup target for S6 operational use. Paraphrase detection requires infrastructure investment
that should be validated against actual content volume at scale. ISSUE-0049 tracks the upgrade path.

Draft-only lifecycle (Decision 6): Consistent with spec §15.3 FSM start state (`draft`). The `draft →
review` gate requires "all required fields populated" and is "partly for" copyright review (spec §15.3).
A lifecycle override in the manifest would bypass this gate — not acceptable given the copyright
constraint.

assessment-svc carry (Decision 5): ADR-0040 §Decision explicitly scoped the ISSUE-0042 fix to
content-svc. Expanding S6 to fix assessment-svc would add untracked scope and create a traceability
break for the ADR-0040 decision boundary.

## Consequences

- Positive: Import pipeline has machine-enforceable copyright guardrail at two levels (manifest
  `copyright_declaration` field + lifecycle FSM `draft → review` gate).
- Positive: Spec §21.2 `POST /content/import` path honored; no path drift from spec.
- Positive: Dry-run mode (`?dry_run=true`) enables pre-flight validation without DB writes — essential
  for S7 authoring iteration at volume.
- Positive: Per-item partial-failure reporting ensures no silent half-import.
- Negative: No fuzzy similarity check in S6; paraphrase-level reproduction detection depends on human
  review at `draft → review` lifecycle gate.
- Negative: No script-based import convenience in S6; CLI batch use requires calling the authenticated
  endpoint with Idempotency-Key.
- Follow-ups:
  - ISSUE-0049: fuzzy/embedding-based duplicate detection (post-launch, tracked).
  - ISSUE-0050: cross-DB exact-match stem SHA dedup + cross-import external_key dedup
    (Q-1.1-6.7 + Q-1.1-6.8 deferral upgrade path; distinct from ISSUE-0049 fuzzy approach).
  - Legal review of authoring spec templates (operator-side gate before S7.1 — no code action).
  - assessment-svc ISSUE-0042 second half: carry to next assessment-svc touch (ADR-0040).

## Implementation notes

**Manifest format (versioned JSON — `docs/content/manifest-format.md` Gate III deliverable):**

Each manifest item must include:
- `external_key: string` — operator-supplied stable key for per-item idempotency dedup (survives re-import)
- `copyright_declaration: 'original'` — required `z.literal('original')` field; 422 on missing/invalid
- `response_type`, `skill_ids`, `difficulty`, `year_levels`, `exam_families` — required (matching `ItemCreateDTOSchema`)
- `stem`, `response_config` — required (matching `ItemVersionCreateDTOSchema`)
- Optional: `source_item_id`, `stimulus_id`, `discrimination`, `expected_time_secs`, `programs`,
  `countries`, `curricula`, `bloom_level`, `distractor_rationale`, `explanation`
- NOT included: `lifecycle` — always `draft`; no override (Decision 6)

Manifest root must include `"version": "1"` for forward-compatible schema evolution.

**Dry-run mode:** `?dry_run=true` query param. Runs full Zod parse + curriculum-strand coverage check
+ SHA dup check; returns same partial-failure shape as live import but performs no DB writes. Required
per spec §21.2 ("with dry-run validation").

**Partial-failure response shape:**
```json
{
  "imported": 42,
  "rejected": 3,
  "dry_run": false,
  "items": [
    { "external_key": "item-001", "status": "ok", "item_id": "uuid" },
    { "external_key": "item-002", "status": "rejected", "reason": "exam_families: Required" },
    { "external_key": "item-003", "status": "duplicate", "reason": "SHA match: existing item_id uuid" }
  ]
}
```

Never a silent half-import: every item in the manifest appears in `items[]` with `status: ok | rejected
| duplicate`. The endpoint returns 200 even when items are rejected (per-item status carries the
outcome); 422 is reserved for manifest-level parse failures (malformed JSON or missing version field).

**SHA dup check:** `SHA-256(JSON.stringify(normaliseStem(stem)))` where `normaliseStem` sorts object keys
recursively and strips insignificant whitespace. Compared against SHAs computed from `item_version.stem`
for `is_current = true` rows at batch start. Items matching an existing SHA are recorded as `status:
"duplicate"` with the matching `item_id`. Does not block import of distinct items in the same batch.

**Idempotency model:** `Idempotency-Key` header applies to the entire batch request — prevents duplicate
batch submission (same key = same response). Per-item idempotency uses the manifest `external_key`
field: items with a matching `external_key` in the idempotency record for `POST /content/import` return
the previously-created `item_id` without re-inserting. Re-importing the same manifest is idempotent.

**T5 backend-artefact adaptation (Q-1.1-6.5):** S6 has no UI. T5's three-gate flow is adapted:
- Gate I: API design sketch (`docs/content/manifest-format.md` draft + this ADR, status `proposed`) →
  operator "proceed to checkpoint B" before any handler code
- Gate II: `importItems` handler skeleton in `handlers.ts` (signature + Zod parse + throw stubs) +
  `ItemImportManifestSchema` in `packages/types/src/content.ts` + router branch in `index.ts` +
  test stubs → operator "proceed to fill" before business logic
- Gate III: Full implementation (idempotency, partial-failure loop, SHA dup check, dry-run branch,
  contract tests ≥5, authoring spec templates, manifest-format.md final) → V1–V11 + "create the commit"
  ADR-0041 status updated to `accepted` at Gate III.

**Implementation tightenings (Gate III):**
- **T1 — normaliseStem: no case folding.** `normaliseStem(stem)` = `JSON.stringify(sortKeys(stem)).trim()`.
  No `.toLowerCase()`. Casing is semantic in stem text: mathematical variables (`x`/`X`), chemical
  notation (`pH`/`PH`), units (`mL`/`ML`). Recorded in `docs/content/manifest-format.md §5`.
- **T2 — version.supersedes omitted.** `version.supersedes` is not a field in
  `ImportManifestItemSchema`. Batch import creates fresh `draft` items only. `supersedes` is a
  separate admin operation for relating a new `item_version` to an existing item — not an import
  concern.

**Legal review hard gate for S7.1:** Authoring spec templates (`docs/content/specs/`) shipped at Gate III
ready for legal review. S7.1 batch authoring does not begin until sign-off received. Owner: operator-side.
No code gate — operational process only. Recorded here for traceability.

**Step 1b addendum (2026-05-19) — authoring_method provenance column (Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-1 Option A):**

Legal review finding 3 identified that `copyright_declaration: 'original'` attests originality but
provides no machine-readable audit trail for *how* an item was created (human-authored vs.
AI-assisted-human-reviewed). `docs/content/specs/australian-y5-numeracy.md §9.2` requires human
originality review for AI-assisted items but had no schema hook to enforce or record compliance.

**Binding decision (Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-1 Option A, 2026-05-19 operator):** Add
`authoring_method: z.enum(['human', 'ai_assisted_human_reviewed'])` to `ImportManifestItemSchema`,
`ItemVersionCreateDTOSchema`, and `ItemVersionDTOSchema`. Add `authoring_method text NOT NULL CHECK
(authoring_method IN ('human', 'ai_assisted_human_reviewed'))` to `item_version` (migration 0023).

Sub-question resolutions:
- Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-1.1: Enum values as-drafted — `'human'` and `'ai_assisted_human_reviewed'`. No
  trademark exposure; no change from spec-implicit naming.
- Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-1.2: No backfill. Item bank contains 0 rows at S6 close (Q-1.1-6.7 rationale
  confirmed). `NOT NULL` without `DEFAULT` is safe; no existing rows to backfill.
- Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-1.3: Option A — `NOT NULL`, no `DEFAULT`. Silent defaulting (e.g., `DEFAULT
  'human'`) would defeat the audit trail by allowing imports to omit the field without error.
  Every INSERT is forced to declare authoring provenance explicitly.
- Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-1.4: Required Zod field, no `.default()`. Matches Option A constraint at the
  schema layer: `z.enum([...])` without `.default()` rejects `undefined` at parse time.

Enforcement surfaces: (1) `ImportManifestSchema.safeParse()` at `POST /content/import` router
boundary — manifest-level 422 on absent/invalid. (2) `createItemVersion` manual validation guard
— REST-path 422 VALIDATION_ERROR on absent. (3) `item_version` CHECK constraint — DB-layer
rejection even if the application layer is bypassed.

Note: `item_version` is effectively immutable after insert (no UPDATE path exists in
`handlers.ts`). `authoring_method` must therefore be declared at INSERT time. The `NOT NULL, no
DEFAULT` constraint is the correct shape for an immutable provenance field.

**Step 1c addendum (2026-05-20) — exam_family enum rename (Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-2 Option A):**

Legal review finding 9 identified that `exam_family` enum values `'naplan'` and `'icas'` expose
trademark strings in public-facing API responses (`GET /pathways`), student UI (`session-selection/
page.tsx`), and teacher UI (`teacher/content/page.tsx`). All enum values appear verbatim in API wire
format to any authenticated user.

**Binding decision (Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-2 Option A, 2026-05-19 operator):** Full enum rename via
`ALTER TYPE RENAME VALUE` (migration 0024). No display-name-map-only approach (Option B) — the
trademark strings must not appear in the DB enum or API wire format.

Sub-question resolutions:
- **Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-2.1 (rename mapping):** `'naplan'` → `'au_numeracy_y5_format'`;
  `'icas'` → `'au_math_paper_c_format'`. Neutral identifiers — format + year-level + subject
  descriptors, no trademark strings.
- **Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-2.2 (commit atomicity):** Single atomic feat commit covering migration + all
  code sites (seeds, tests, UI, docs). Per DEV-20260515-2 discipline.
- **Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-2.3 (UI display label pattern):** Option A — `EXAM_FAMILY_DISPLAY_LABELS`
  map at `apps/web/src/lib/content-labels.ts` with `getExamFamilyLabel()` helper. Labels:
  `'au_numeracy_y5_format'` → `'Numeracy Y5'`; `'au_math_paper_c_format'` → `'Math Paper C'`.
  Decouples internal DB identifier from user-facing string; the helper is the single translation
  point for all future call sites.
- **Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-2.4 (scope of rename):** Enum rename only. Other trademark surfaces (program
  column values `'NAPLAN'`/`'ICAS'`, `display_name` values, pathway slugs, `feature_key` values,
  UI copy strings) are deferred to ISSUE-0051 for separate legal + operational review. The enum
  is the highest-risk surface (API wire format exposure); the others are lower-risk (internal
  identifiers or display strings already modifiable without a DDL change).
- **Q-1.1-S7-LEGAL-2.5 (intelligence-svc slug coupling fix):** Option A — DB lookup. Handler
  previously extracted exam_family by splitting pathway slug (`pathwaySlug.split('-')[0]`); after
  rename the slug prefix `'naplan'` would no longer match the new enum value `'au_numeracy_y5_format'`,
  breaking skill filtering silently (0 skills → 404). Fixed by adding `exam_family` to the pathway
  SELECT and reading `pathway.exam_family` directly — removes the slug-split coupling entirely.

**Migration 0024 DDL (one-way, no backfill):**
```sql
ALTER TYPE exam_family RENAME VALUE 'naplan' TO 'au_numeracy_y5_format';
ALTER TYPE exam_family RENAME VALUE 'icas'   TO 'au_math_paper_c_format';
```
`ALTER TYPE RENAME VALUE` updates the enum label in-place; existing rows are updated by Postgres
without a data backfill scan. One-way DDL: no reverse migration; any rollback would require a
re-rename (which is safe, but operationally non-trivial — flag for deploy runbook).

**EXAM_FAMILY_DISPLAY_LABELS pattern:** `apps/web/src/lib/content-labels.ts` is the canonical
translation point. Any new call site rendering `exam_family` to users must call
`getExamFamilyLabel(examFamily)`. Do not render raw enum values in UI.

**ISSUE-0051 cross-reference (Q-2.4 carry):** Non-enum trademark surfaces remain. See ISSUE-0051
for the full enumerated list and resolution path (program column, display_name values, pathway
slugs, feature_key values, UI copy strings). ISSUE-0051 requires separate legal review before
any remediation is scoped.

**S7 morning ritual addendum (2026-05-20) — manifest authoring constraints (Q-1.1-7.T1A + Q-1.1-7.T1B):**

T1 pre-read at S7 morning ritual identified two manifest authoring constraints not previously documented in this ADR. Both are resolved before any S7.1 authoring begins (operator decisions, 2026-05-20):

**`response_type` must match DB enum verbatim (Q-1.1-7.T1A Option A):**
The `item.response_type` column uses the Postgres `response_type` enum defined in migration 0001:
`'mcq', 'multi_select', 'short_answer', 'extended_response', 'drag_drop', 'cloze', 'numeric_entry'`

`importItems` passes the manifest `response_type` string directly to Supabase INSERT (`handlers.ts:853`). The `ImportManifestItemSchema` uses `z.string()`, so Zod does not validate against enum values — the DB enforces the constraint. A mismatch produces a DB-level error; the item is rejected with `status: "rejected"`. There is no translation layer.

Prior template and manifest-format docs incorrectly used `"multiple_choice"` and `"short_response"`. Both are not valid enum values. Corrected in this chore: template §4 and manifest-format §9 now use `"mcq"` and `"short_answer"`.

For S7.1 pilot: use `"mcq"` for all multiple-choice items; `"short_answer"` for all numeric short-response items.

**`skill_ids` must be UUIDs from `skill_node` table (Q-1.1-7.T1B Option C):**
The `item.skill_ids` column is `uuid[] NOT NULL`. `importItems` passes manifest `skill_ids` directly to INSERT without slug-to-UUID resolution (`handlers.ts:854`). Slug-format strings (e.g., `"fractions-decimals"`) cause a DB UUID cast error; item rejected.

Authors must supply the UUID values from the `skill_node` table. Seeded UUIDs for S7.1 (`seeds/01_skill_graph.sql`):
- `place-value` → `a0000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000004`
- `fractions-decimals` → `a0000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000005`
- `operations` → `a0000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000006`
- `word-problems` → `a0000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000007`
- `geometry` → `a0000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000008`
- `data-interpretation` → `a0000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000009`

Slug resolution upgrade deferred: ISSUE-0052 tracks adding slug→UUID resolution inside `importItems` (same pattern as `selectFromBlueprint` at `handlers.ts:481`). Post-S7.1.

**S7.1 workflow addendum (2026-05-20) — Q-1.1-7.1..9 resolutions:**

Q-1.1-7.1..9 were raised at S7 morning ritual (T3 structural — all 9 required operator round-trip before S7.1 opens). All defaults accepted 2026-05-20. Binding decisions recorded here as an ADR addendum:

**Authoring approach (Q-1.1-7.1):** Hybrid — `authoring_method: "ai_assisted_human_reviewed"` on all S7.1 items. Claude drafts original items to `docs/content/specs/australian-y5-numeracy.md` template; operator reviews against §9.2 checklist and commits.

**Authoring source format (Q-1.1-7.2):** Direct manifest JSON per `docs/content/manifest-format.md` (Option A). No intermediate tooling for S7.1 pilot. Revisit at S7.2+ if volume demands.

**Originality review artifact (Q-1.1-7.3 + Q-1.1-7.3.1 tightening):** Operator-side review. Artifact: `docs/content/reviews/<batch>.md`, per-item entries using 7-item checklist at `docs/content/reviews/_template.md`. Committed in same batch commit as manifest. Checklist covers: `copyright_declaration: "original"` attestation; authoring_method match; §9.1 prohibited methods not used; §9.2 AI clause satisfied; similarity check performed; curriculum alignment verified; approval to transition to `review` lifecycle.

**Import target environment (Q-1.1-7.4):** Local Supabase for S7.1 dry-runs and live import. Content migration to preview/staging deferred to pre-launch gate.

**Lifecycle transition ownership (Q-1.1-7.5):** Operator-only triggers transitions via content-svc lifecycle endpoint. `draft → review` gates on review-log entry present (Q-1.1-7.3 artifact). `review → active` blocked on DEV-20260520-1 legal pre-launch gate. Items may accumulate in `review` state during S7.1.

**Test gate for S7 commits (Q-1.1-7.6):** Per-batch dry-run only (Option B). `POST /content/import?dry_run=true` zero-rejections required before each live import. No new unit test files. Dry-run IS the test.

**Commit granularity (Q-1.1-7.7):** Per-batch (Option B). One commit per import run: manifest JSON + review log + `docs/content/coverage.md` update, atomic. Commit message format: `content(s7.1): batch N — <strand> <item-count> items imported`.

**Manifest file storage (Q-1.1-7.8):** In-repo at `docs/content/manifests/<batch>.json`. Directory bootstrapped with `.gitkeep` in this chore. Scale review at S7.2+.

**T5 content-adapted 3-gate flow (Q-1.1-7.9):**
- Gate I: dry-run of first 5–10 pilot items (format + coverage direction check) → operator approval before remaining S7.1 items are authored.
- Gate II: full 50-item manifest dry-run (`POST /content/import?dry_run=true`) → zero rejections → operator approval before live import.
- Gate III: live import + `docs/content/coverage.md` update committed.

**DEV-20260520-1 still active:** No item may be set to `active` until pre-launch legal gate clears. Items authored in S7.1 land as `draft`; may be advanced to `review` (with review-log entry); `review → active` blocked.

**Gate I T3 addendum (2026-05-20) — response_config shape correction (Q-1.1-S7-RC.1):**

T3 structural round-trip at S7.1 Gate I identified a three-way shape inconsistency in MCQ
`response_config` across the spec docs and the delivery-time engine.

**Finding:** `manifest-format.md §9` used `"correct"` + `string[]` options; `australian-y5-numeracy.md
§6/§10` used `"correct"` + `[{key,text}]` object arrays. Both were wrong on at least one dimension:
- `computeCorrectness` (`assessment-svc/handlers.ts:1068`) reads `cfg['correct_option_id']` — the
  field `"correct"` is never read; MCQ items authored with `"correct"` score permanently incorrect
- `readOptions` (`apps/web/exam/page.tsx:62-68`) expects `string[]` — object arrays return `[]`
  (student sees "This question type is not yet supported" instead of options)
- Assessment-svc contract test fixtures (lines 82-85) confirm `correct_option_id` is the intended key

**Binding decision (Q-1.1-S7-RC.1 Option A, 2026-05-20 operator):** Flat string options +
`correct_option_id`. Server ground truth wins; spec docs corrected.

Correct MCQ `response_config` shape for all manifest items:
```json
{
  "options": ["<text A>", "<text B>", "<text C>", "<text D>"],
  "correct_option_id": "<text — must match one options element exactly, case-sensitive>",
  "scoring": { "correct": 1, "incorrect": 0 }
}
```

Docs corrected: `manifest-format.md §3.2` (subfield conventions added) + `§9` (minimal example);
`australian-y5-numeracy.md §6` (MCQ block rewritten) + `§10` (complete example response_config).

**By-product finding (ISSUE-0054):** Pre-existing v1 scoring bug — exam page submits
`{ choice: selected }` (`exam/page.tsx:282`) but `computeCorrectness` reads `responseData['option_id']`
(`handlers.ts:1070`). MCQ auto-scoring therefore non-functional in v1 exam mode regardless of content
shape. Filed as ISSUE-0054 (high severity, pre-launch blocker). Fix: change `exam/page.tsx:282` to
submit `{ option_id: selected }`.
